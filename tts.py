# This is a placeholder for a Sinhala TTS model.
# A simple, functional model for this architecture is not readily available on Hugging Face.
# You would need a pre-trained model file in this directory.
# For example, let's assume you have a model named `sinhala_tts.pt`.
# This approach requires a locally stored model.

# This is a simplified example. A real model would require more complex code.
# The code below is for demonstration and might not work with a real-world model.
# I am providing this to demonstrate the architecture for a non-Hugging Face pipeline approach.

try:
    # Get the text to be converted from command-line arguments
    text_to_speak = sys.argv[1]

    # --- A real-world, non-Hugging Face model would be loaded here ---
    # For a simple Sinhala TTS, a custom model might be needed.
    # Since there are no stable, publicly available Sinhala TTS models
    # that work with simple pip installations without errors,
    # this part is a conceptual example.

    # Simulating a TTS output for demonstration purposes
    # A real model would convert Sinhala text to audio.
    dummy_audio = np.random.rand(16000) * 0.5  # Generate a dummy audio waveform
    sample_rate = 16000

    # Save the generated audio to a WAV file
    sf.write(output_path, dummy_audio, sample_rate)
